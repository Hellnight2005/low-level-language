# C++ Learning Roadmap

## Beginner Level

### 1. Introduction to C++
   - [ ] Understand the basics of C++ and its history.
   - [ ] Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio Code) and write a "Hello World" program.

### 2. Variables and Data Types
   - [ ] Learn about fundamental data types: int, float, double, char.
   - [ ] Declare variables and perform basic arithmetic operations.

### 3. Control Flow
   - [ ] Understand if statements for decision-making.
   - [ ] Use switch statements for multiple conditions.
   - [ ] Implement loops: for, while, do-while.

### 4. Functions
   - [ ] Define and call functions.
   - [ ] Understand parameters and return values in functions.

### 5. Arrays and Strings
   - [ ] Work with arrays and understand their usage.
   - [ ] Manipulate strings and use string functions.

## Intermediate Level

### 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - [ ] Grasp the concepts of classes and objects.
   - [ ] Implement inheritance for code reuse.
   - [ ] Explore polymorphism through function overloading and virtual functions.
   - [ ] Use encapsulation to bundle data and methods.

### 7. Pointers and References
   - [ ] Understand pointers and their applications.
   - [ ] Learn about references and their differences from pointers.
   - [ ] Explore dynamic memory allocation and deallocation (new and delete).

### 8. File Handling
   - [ ] Read from and write to files using file streams.
   - [ ] Understand file modes and error handling in file operations.

### 9. Exception Handling
   - [ ] Implement try-catch blocks for handling exceptions.
   - [ ] Learn about the standard exception classes.

## Advanced Level

### 10. Templates and Generic Programming
   - [ ] Understand template programming for generic data types.
   - [ ] Explore function templates and class templates.

### 11. Standard Template Library (STL)
   - [ ] Utilize containers like vectors, lists, and maps.
   - [ ] Understand algorithms provided by the STL.

### 12. Multi-threading
   - [ ] Learn the basics of multi-threading in C++.
   - [ ] Explore synchronization mechanisms like mutex and semaphore.

### 13. Best Practices and Optimization
   - [ ] Follow best practices for clean and efficient code.
   - [ ] Understand memory management and optimization techniques.
